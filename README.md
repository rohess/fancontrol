# fancontrol
scripts for reading data from a DHT22 humidity/temperature sensor on a Raspberry Pi and calculating dew point difference between two sensors. The sensor data is sent to an mqtt broker, and based on the dew point difference between the inside and outside sensor, a fan is switched on and off.
